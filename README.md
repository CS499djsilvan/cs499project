#:sparkles: Sleep Buddy :sparkles:
A simple and intuitive way to record your dreams.

##About :white_check_mark:
Ever wake up from an awesome dream just to find that you forget about most of it within 5 minutes? Enter Sleep Buddy, an app designed to help you remember your dreams for as long as you have an Android phone! Sleep Buddy is a :free: dream journal app with a recording feature that allows you to say your dream out loud and save the recordings for later playback (instead of trying to write your dream down in a conventional dream journal and forgetting the dream while writing it out). The sound files of the recordings are designed to have crisp, HD sound quality that will allow you to clearly hear exactly what happened in your recorded dream. In addition to the dream journal, this app includes a nightlight with a custom color picker and tips on how to get better sleep.
